# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization Project

## Overview

The Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository contains a wealth of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal of this project is to extract, transform, and visualize this data in an interactive and user-friendly manner. The solution involves scripting to extract data, transforming it into a suitable format, inserting it into a MySQL database, and creating a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Data Extraction

Clone the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository using scripting to fetch the data and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.

### 2. Data Transformation

Utilize Python, along with libraries like Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This involves cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

### 3. Database Insertion

Connect to a MySQL database using the "mysql-connector-python" library and insert the transformed data using SQL commands for efficient storage and retrieval.

### 4. Dashboard Creation

Create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python. Utilize Plotly's built-in geo map functions to display data on a map and Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface. Implement at least 10 dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures for display.

### 5. Data Retrieval

Connect to the MySQL database using the "mysql-connector-python" library to fetch data into a Pandas dataframe. Dynamically update the dashboard based on the latest data.

### 6. Deployment

Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Thoroughly test the solution and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.

## Approach

The project leverages the power of Python and its libraries for data extraction, transformation, and analysis. The combination of Streamlit and Plotly facilitates the creation of an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.

## Results

The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard displaying insights from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The dashboard will offer at least 10 dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures. Data will be efficiently stored in a MySQL database, and the dashboard will dynamically update to reflect the latest information.

Users can access the dashboard from a web browser, navigate different visualizations, and gain valuable insights for data analysis and decision-making. This comprehensive and user-friendly solution aims to enhance the understanding and utilization of data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository.
